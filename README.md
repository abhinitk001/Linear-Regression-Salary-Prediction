# Linear-Regression-Salary-Prediction

Linear Regression Salary Prediction is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts a person’s salary based on years of experience using a Simple Linear Regression model.
This project demonstrates how supervised learning works with real-world style data by identifying the relationship between experience (independent variable) and salary (dependent variable) and generating a best-fit regression line for prediction.

Problem Type:
This is a Simple Linear Regression problem because only one input variable (Years of Experience) is used to train the model and predict salary.

Output:
Trains a Linear Regression model
Predicts salary for new experience values
Displays a graph showing actual data points and the regression line
